        About Us
        
        Our founder, Matthew Yahes, has spent his life building businesses, big and small, from the ground up.
        He’s always believed in the power of outsourcing because he’s seen it work time and time again.
        
        But he was often met with skepticism from other entrepreneurs that didn’t think it was possible to find top, remote talent that would seamlessly integrate within their organizations, especially since most outsourcing companies were in the business of staffing bodies instead of team members.
        
        Together with our management team, a collection of top business leaders and entrepreneurs, Matthew founded Extend Your Team to serve as a trusted partner for organizations looking to do outsourcing right.`,
